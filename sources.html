    <h1> Research Sources </h1>
    <h2> Movement Advancement Project </h2>
    <p> The Movement Advancement Project is an organization dedicated to providing research and insight in order to promote equality for all people. This website especially focuses on data regarding LGBTQ people and provides demographic information regarding LGBTQ issues. Using this website, I was able to find maps estimating the number of LGBT people living in each state. The data seems to be up to date and is based on studies conducted by the CDC.</p>
    <h2> ScienceDirect </h2>
    <p> ScienceDirect is a database published by Elsevier, a global information analytics company. It is a leading source for scientific and medical research, and it contains millions of peer-reviewed articles. The study that I looked at essentially discusses suicide statistics among different age groups and sexual/gender identity categories. It helps to highlight the disparities between these groups, as well as where these disparities are more commonly found.</p>
    <h2> Statista </h2>
    <p> Statista is a resource that provides direct access to quantitative data on a variety of different topics. Using this resource, I was able to find quite a few graphs related to LGBTQ health that had been compiled into a single dossier. I eventually settled on a study that focused on feelings of hopelessness among high schoolers, organized by gender and sexual orientation. The data I used was collected by the CDC and appears to be well updated.</p>
    <h2> The Trevor Project </h2>
    <p> The Trevor Project is an organization that provides help to LGBTQ individuals and produces innovative research that provides insight into suicide as well as LGBTQ issues. It is an immensely valuable resource that partners with academic institutions in order to monitor and collect data. I was able to find datasets covering a few aspects of LGBTQ mental health within a national survey that is conducted annually. More specifically, this report contains data outlining why LGBTQ individuals might be unable to get mental health care.</p>
    <h2> GLSEN </h2>
    <p> The Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network, or GLSEN, is an organization working to end discrimination in schools based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression. It conducts research on LGBTQ issues and works to promote policies and solutions to improve the lives of LGBTQ youth. One part of this effort is their National School Climate Survey which reports on the challenges that LGBTQ students face in schools, as well as the impact of school resources. I was able to find data that highlights the types of harassment that students experience.</p>
