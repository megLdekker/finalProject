        <h1> Mental Health Issues Among LGBTQIA+ Individuals</h1>
        <p> This webpage will be used to examine mental health statistics as they pertain to members of the LGBTQIA+ community. The purpose of this study is to find whether these issues disproportionately affect members of the LGBTQIA+ community (and it is my understanding that they do) and to make a call to action.</p>
